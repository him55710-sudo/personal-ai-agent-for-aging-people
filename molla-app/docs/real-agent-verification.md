# Real agent upgrade verification

Branch: `feat/real-agent-mobile-vm`. Reused the backend merged at `f7e79de`, synchronized with main `23572ff` before the PR, and integrated main through `58a56e8` for the connection repair follow-up. Verification date: 2026-11-09.

## Implemented

- `apps/api/src/server.mjs`, `storage.mjs`, `schema.mjs`: authenticated mobile routes, expiring/revocable owner credentials, strict owner identity, separate SQLite files, TLS or trusted loopback proxy, private ACLs, rate limits, durable idempotency receipts and recovery.
- `apps/api/src/agent.mjs`, `provider.mjs`: real provider adapter, JSON Schema function calls, consented owner memory/contact lookups, finite planning loop and exact-action approval. Unsupported/fabricated tool calls stop execution. Model text cannot invoke ADB or approve a task.
- `molla-cli/runtime/lifecycle.mjs`, `lib/execute.mjs`, `runtime/{domain,phone,orchestrator}.mjs`: canonical policy/execution reuse, durable lifecycle, pre-effect permission checks, observed evidence and conservative uncertainty handling. Legacy server modules re-export this core instead of duplicating it.
- `apps/api/src/android.mjs`: real ADB executor, foreground verification, SMS recipient/body UI verification without sending, Settings-only element inspection and navigation with screen-hash checks.
- `server/cloud-vm.mjs`, `workers/cloud_manager.py`: recorded owner/session/request recovery, no unrelated-session adoption, provider deadline and cleanup confirmation, connection status polling without re-renting.
- `apps/api/src/family.mjs` and mobile `FamilyControls.tsx`: parent-issued relationship code, explicit parent acceptance, request-only helper role, parent-only task approval and revocation. Helper sees a receipt only.
- Mobile `LiveCompanionStore.tsx`, `runtime.ts`, `types.ts`, `TaskScreen.tsx`, `ProfileScreen.tsx`: exact reviewed approval hash, stable mutation IDs, lifecycle labels, device/risk display and cancellation. Existing design and 8-second polling remain.

## Automated fixtures (no external model or rented phone)

| Suite | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| New owner API, tool adapter, Android evidence and mobile HTTP integration | 18/18 pass |
| Python Phone Harness receipt/recovery adapter | 8/8 pass |
| Existing server/policy/phone/screen tests | 71/71 pass after latest main merge |
| Mobile TypeScript | pass |
| Mobile HTTP runtime | 5/5 pass |
| React Native Web UI flows | 9 checks pass; mocked API, not live provider evidence |
| Mobile web export | pass |
| `fa-kakao-demo` after latest main merge | 34/34 pass |
| `fa-engine` including family ontology | 39/39 pass |
| `fa-trust` after latest main merge | 61/61 pass (`node --import tsx --test test/*.test.ts`) |
| Standalone CLI on Windows | 23/25 pass, same two baseline failures: POSIX mode assertion and Windows symlink creation permission |
| Linux GitHub Actions | pass: original CLI suite, new API, Python adapter, existing server, mobile TypeScript and HTTP runtime |

The Windows CLI failures were not hidden or converted into passes. The new API separately applies a private Windows directory ACL. [Linux CI run 42562986787](https://github.com/him55710-sudo/personal-ai-agent-for-aging-people/actions/runs/42562986787) passed on commit `36c6ff49c8a42817274e6ca3150d48a1e5442960`, including the unchanged CLI permission/symlink tests. This is CI evidence, not a local Linux run or a live provider test.

The fixture pipeline uses the actual mobile `apiRequest` implementation, real HTTP API and SQLite, plus controlled model/ADB responses. It verifies that an unapproved action cannot execute, a different owner cannot approve/read it, a changed hash is rejected, a duplicate cannot run twice, cancellation/timeout/restart never invent success, and family helpers cannot inherit parent privileges.

## Real environment

### Connection repair follow-up — 2026-11-09

The user declined additional billing and requested code-only repair. No VM rental or model generation was made in this follow-up. Free authenticated reads reached Phone Harness `/me` successfully three times, confirmed the one saved Android, and reached Letsur `/models`. An initial GitHub DNS lookup failed and a subsequent fetch succeeded; the host network has shown intermittent failures, so these reads do not establish reliable ADB connectivity.

Code repairs remove `/me` as a dependency of session status/cleanup, skip ADB connection when recovering a session for shutdown, retry only transient GET failures once, and require explicit cleanup confirmation before reporting stopped. LLM network errors now have a distinct safe error code. Live verification supports a separately approved 1–5 minute cap and clearer progress/error reporting; no new allowance is implied. The parent still must install/login to apps where needed, and any future paid verification needs fresh approval.

The request to put the tested code on main does not change the unverified status of scenarios B/C. Latest main changes, including the legacy Terra adapter and FA safeguards, are preserved.

Credentials were loaded from the existing private local configuration. No API key, app token, provider session ID or ADB unlock secret is committed. Read-only account catalog confirms one saved Android profile; only mom is mapped. Dad/son remain unassigned.

User authorized an aggregate maximum of US$0.15 for this phone verification and six model calls, with no SMS sending. First attempt: actual Letsur `gpt-4.1-mini` conversation through the new owner API and mobile transport **passed**. VM was admitted, but connection diagnosis failed before app execution. The official create receipt subsequently confirmed cleanup; session history reports one minute / US$0.05. See `live/agent-upgrade-live-attempt-1.json`.

A second bounded attempt used only the remaining two-minute / US$0.10 allowance and at most five remaining model calls. The model and Phone Harness requests encountered provider/network errors (`URLError`, remote disconnect, connection timeout during read-only diagnostics). The original create receipt subsequently confirmed `released`, `cleanup_complete=true`, and no active session matching that request. Total model calls across both attempts: 2. First rental billed US$0.05; the second was capped at US$0.10, so aggregate authorized maximum was US$0.15. No further VM was created. Final observed status is recorded in `live/agent-upgrade-live-report.json`; it must not be interpreted as a passing Android demonstration.

**Scenario B (real Kakao foreground) and Scenario C (real SMS compose UI) are not verified on this upgraded backend.** Installed Kakao and a supported SMS app must be checked by the owner on a reachable VM. No live text was sent. Native APK/IPA installation, physical-phone rendering and a deployed public HTTPS endpoint were not tested. Prior legacy-server Settings demonstrations and mock screenshots do not prove these new scenarios.

## Run / finish verification

See [`apps/api/README.md`](../apps/api/README.md) for variables, credential issuance, TLS, local execution and bounded live test commands. This branch has its own `.env` and owner keys in `apps/api/.data`, separate from the original app's credentials/state. On this PC, use API port 4319 and native-web review port 4325. Parent consent is initially pending; a family member cannot enable it on their behalf.

Remaining release gates: establish reliable Phone Harness API/ADB connectivity, confirm real session cleanup when a receipt is unavailable, run B/C with a fresh explicitly approved budget, test the native installed app, configure public HTTPS, and review token delivery/rotation with the actual owners. The user subsequently requested main integration while declining new paid tests; merging the code does not satisfy these live release gates.
