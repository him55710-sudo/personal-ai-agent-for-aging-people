# Molla owner API

The authenticated owner and Android execution API. It imports the **same** `molla-cli` policy, domain, memory, SQLite store and execution core. `molla-app/server` re-exports those modules for legacy compatibility. The [Cheese KakaoTalk mockup](../../../fa-kakao-demo/README.md) is the repository's product UI and runs its own simulations. The live API is operated separately.

## Run locally

Node 24+, pnpm, and Python 3.10+ for Phone Harness. From the repository:

```powershell
cd molla-app/apps/api
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Fill provider settings in this server-only file.
pnpm owner issue mom 엄마
pnpm owner issue dad 아빠
pnpm owner issue son 자녀
pnpm start
```

The operator issues each owner a separate 256-bit credential; only its SHA-256 hash and 30-day expiry enter `owners.json`. Issuing a replacement revokes previous keys for that owner. `pnpm owner revoke mom` revokes all mom credentials. Raw keys are stored only in private `.data/<owner>-access.txt` for direct delivery to that owner, never a URL/family chat. API keys are not app credentials. Windows uses a private directory ACL; Unix uses mode 0700/0600. The API has no demo login or cookie fallback.

Use the exact API origin and the owner's key with an authenticated HTTP client. Development HTTP is limited to loopback, while public or LAN use requires HTTPS. Owner acceptance, AI processing, memory use by AI, Android permission, VM cost acceptance and individual task approval are distinct decisions.

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MOLLA_ENV=development` | Explicit loopback HTTP; omit for production |
| `MOLLA_HOST`, `PORT` | Default `127.0.0.1:4319` |
| `MOLLA_TLS_CERT`, `MOLLA_TLS_KEY` | Direct HTTPS with PEM files |
| `MOLLA_TRUST_LOOPBACK_PROXY=1` | Alternative: HTTPS proxy on same host, API bound only to loopback; proxy replaces forwarded headers |
| `MOLLA_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `MOLLA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Exact host/CORS allowlists; no wildcard credentials |
| `MOLLA_API_DATA_DIR`, `MOLLA_API_AUTH_FILE` | Private storage/auth paths; defaults inside this package's `.data` |
| `MOLLA_LLM_PROVIDER` | `openai-compatible`, `letsur`, or `vercel`; no automatic provider fallback |
| `MOLLA_LLM_BASE_URL`, `MOLLA_LLM_API_KEY`, `MOLLA_LLM_MODEL` | Generic compatible endpoint/key/model with function calling |
| `LETSUR_API_KEY`, `LETSUR_MODEL` | Letsur preset, official `https://gw.letsur.ai/v1` |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `MOLLA_MODEL` | Vercel compatible preset |
| `MOLLA_LLM_ENABLED=1`, `MOLLA_LLM_TIMEOUT_MS` | Enable inference; default 40-second overall turn deadline |
| `MOLLA_LLM_DAILY_REQUEST_LIMIT` | Per-owner rolling 24-hour request limit, default 40; max six model turns/request |
| `MOLLA_RATE_PER_MINUTE` | Persistent per-owner HTTP limit, default 120 |
| `MOLLA_ADB` | Absolute path to official Android Platform Tools |
| `MOLLA_ALLOW_ANDROID_APPS/COMPOSE/UI=1` | Enable corresponding executors, still subject to owner policy |
| `MOLLA_PHONE_BINDINGS` | Optional unique local ADB bindings, JSON by owner |
| `MOLLA_CLOUD_BINDINGS` or `MOLLA_CLOUD_BINDINGS_FILE` | Unique saved Phone Harness profiles by owner |
| `MOLLA_PHONE_HARNESS_PATH`, `PHONE_HARNESS_HOME` | Pinned official client checkout and private operator login directory |
| `MOLLA_VM_MAX_MINUTES` | 1–5 minute cap; quote shown before each paid start |

Phone Harness setup: run `node ../../scripts/setup-phone-harness.mjs`, install its documented Python requirements and official ADB, then log in directly through `../../scripts/phone-cloud.ps1`. Use `../../scripts/cloud-bind.mjs` to assign an actual saved profile. This account currently has one saved Android, assigned to mom. Dad/son have their own app identities but no VM. No public profile-creation API is assumed. Phone login/password/OTP stays with the account owner.

## Contracts and guarantees

All `/api/*` calls require a server-verified bearer credential. The request cannot choose actor, owner, serial, session, tool command or policy. Each owner's personal state is in a separate SQLite database. `family-links.sqlite` contains relationship metadata only. One API process owns a data directory; horizontal scaling requires a coordinated execution queue/lease service and is intentionally refused by the process lock.

GET `/runtime`, `/state`, `/phone/screen`. POST `/chat`, `/consent`, `/ai/consent`, `/preferences`, `/task/decision`, `/contacts`, `/phone/quote`, `/phone/start`, `/phone/stop`, `/phone/diagnose`. Additional owner memory/contact deletion routes and family invite/join/decision/request routes are implemented.

Send `Idempotency-Key` on mutations. `/chat` and `/family/request` require a stable `requestId`; if both identifiers are provided they must match. Durable receipts never replay interrupted calls. Task approval additionally requires `expectedActionHash` from the reviewed task. Contact duplicates are deduplicated. VM start consumes a policy-bound quote once. There are no automatic retries of model calls, VM creation or device actions. Read-only VM status polling can recover a connection; it cannot rent another VM.

API-created task lifecycle: `created → planned → awaiting_approval → approved → executing → verifying → completed`. Rejection, cancellation, failure and uncertain outcomes are distinct. Verified local drafts finish as `prepared` (legacy-compatible, not an external completion). Restart recovery never executes approved/started tasks. Mid-effect cancellation or missing evidence leaves `needs_verification`. Approvals bind owner/requester/content/recipient/app/device/risk and expire after five minutes.

Tools use strict JSON Schema and a server allowlist. Reads: `memory.search` (separate memory consent), `contact.lookup` (no phone numbers sent to the model). Writes are plans only: `memory.remember`, `phone.app.open`, `phone.sms.compose`, `phone.screen.inspect`, `phone.navigation.step`; the owner must approve. A local draft tool explicitly prepares shopping/calendar text only. Unsupported tools fail closed. Financial transactions, payments, ordering, message sending and subscription cancellation are not implemented.

App opening verifies the foreground package. SMS completion requires a supported SMS app plus exact recipient digits and body visible in the UI; otherwise it remains uncertain. It **never presses Send**. UI navigation currently supports only Settings search controls and list scrolling from a freshly inspected, unchanged screen. Arbitrary taps/coordinates/shell, login screens, password fields and OTP capture are rejected. These narrow capabilities are intentional, not a general phone-control claim.

## Family ownership

The parent generates a 10-minute, one-use **relationship code**. The helper claims it; the parent then explicitly accepts request-only access through their own authenticated session. Linking does not share memory, contacts, conversations, credentials or results. Family requests are planned in the parent's private store, and the helper receives only a receipt. Only the parent can approve that exact plan. Revocation immediately blocks new requests and cancels pending ones. This live path does not inherit the simulated finance/subscription actions in the FA demos.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm test                         # fixtures only, no billing
python tests/cloud_worker_test.py # receipt/cleanup API fixtures
```

Live tests are separate and need explicit authorization. `scripts/verify-live.mjs --android` uses actual model requests and a saved VM, ephemeral private owner state and the shared HTTP client in `../../client/runtime.ts`. It requires `MOLLA_CONFIRM_LIVE_MODEL_CALLS` (1..6), `MOLLA_VERIFY_VM_MINUTES` (1..5), and matching `MOLLA_CONFIRM_VM_MAX_USD`. Keep a cumulative budget across attempts. It opens Kakao if installed, prepares an SMS to a reserved fictional test number, never sends, and requests shutdown in `finally` and a watchdog. The provider's deadline limits the rental even if this process dies. It does not establish a public HTTPS deployment or a real T world sign-in.

Connection recovery retries a transient read at most once (eight-second HTTP timeout per read). Session creation and device effects are never automatically retried. Status/cleanup no longer require a separate catalog lookup, and recovery for shutdown explicitly skips ADB connection. A released receipt without `cleanup_complete` stays `closing`. LLM transport failures are reported as `llm_network_error`, separately from malformed tool output.

See [upgrade verification](../../docs/real-agent-verification.md) for observed results and remaining work. Never copy a fixture result into a live success claim. Installing/login to Kakao and SMS app availability are owner/environment prerequisites.
